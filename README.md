## Usage

Compile the vault server:
    
    cd vault-repo-path
    make

Customize access credentials:

    cp sample_config config.json
    vim config.json

Run the `Secrets Manager` web application, the first time `vaultd` will automatically create its encrypted store:

    ./vaultd -config config.json -app webapps/secrets_manager

Browse `http://localhost:8080/` and login with the credentials you specified in the `config.json` file.
