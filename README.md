# Vault

Vault is an API and HTML+js application server for your secrets.

## Usage

Compile the `vaultd` server:
    
    cd vault-repo-path/vaultd
    make

Customize access credentials:

    cp sample_config config.json
    vim config.json

Run the `Secrets Manager` web application, the first time `vaultd` will automatically create its encrypted store:

    ./vaultd -config config.json -app ../vault

Browse `http://localhost:8080/` and login with the credentials you specified in the `config.json` file.

## Screenshots

Both `vaultd` and the `Secrets Manager` app are work in progress, you might experience some differences with the following screenshots.
