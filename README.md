# Arc

**Arc** is a manager for your secrets made of `arcd`, a RESTful API server written in Go which exposes read and write primitives for **encrypted records** on a sqlite database file.

And `arc`, the client application implemented in html5 and javascript, which runs in every html5 enabled browser and  it is served by `arcd` itself.

Records are generated, encrypted and decrypted **client side only** (Arc relies on CryptoJS for its AES encryption and the PRNG) by `arc`, which offers an intuitive management system equipped with UI widgets including:

- Simple text inputs.
- Simple text areas.
- Custom file attachments (**files are encrypted client side** before being uploaded as binary records).
- A markdown editor area with preview and full screen mode.
- A password field with **password strength estimation** and a **random password generator**. 

Elements can be created (with optional expiration dates), arranged and edited using `arc` and are stored on `arcd` safely.

#### TL;DR 

The idea is to use *the Arc* as a single manager for your passwords, encrypted notes, files and `-all the secret things here-` while hosting `arcd` yourself on some spare hardware like a Raspberry Pi (a very portable setup with a `Zero W` model, or an USB Armory) or a real dedicated server and accessing `arc` from every device with a modern browser.

## Usage

Download, install dependencies and compile the `arcd` server component:

    git clone https://github.com/evilsocket/arc
    cd arc/arcd
    make vendor_get
    make

Now copy the `sample_config.json` file to a new `config.json' file, customize and run the `arc` web application:

    ./arcd -config config.json -app ../arc

Browse `http://localhost:8080/` and login with the credentials you specified in the `config.json` file.

**Note**

The first time the `arcd` server executes the `arc` web application. it will automatically import some example stores from the `arc/seeds.json` seed file (encryption key is `vault`).

## Export and import stores.

You can export stores and their encrypted records to a JSON file:

    ./arcd -config config.json -output ~/backup.json -export

Or export only one store by its numeric id:

    ./arcd -config config.json -output ~/arc_store_1.json -export -store 1 

Such export files can be later imported with:

    ./arcd -config config.json -import ~/backup.json
